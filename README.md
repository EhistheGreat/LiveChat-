# LiveChat-




## how It Works

- The server listens for incoming TCP connections.
- Each client connects to the server using the same IP and port.
- The server receives messages and broadcasts them to all connected clients.
- Each client can type and receive messages in real time.
- Users are identified by their **IP address** or **name** (if added).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### âœ… 1. Start the Server

In one terminal:

```bash
run python3 chatserver.py n host machine 

run the clientchat.py app on another device or you can run it on another terminal
and do again for the second client  ( now they can communicate )
 
 

works like for a one or one communication or a group communication
