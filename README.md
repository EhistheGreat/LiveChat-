# LiveChat-




## how It Works

- The server listens for incoming TCP connections.
- Each client connects to the server using the same IP and port.
- The server receives messages and broadcasts them to all connected clients.
- Each client can type and receive messages in real time.
- Users are identified by their **IP address** or **name** (if added).
